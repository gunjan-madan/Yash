# In one of the previous lessons, you used the print statement to create text art.
# Imagine using the while loop command and the print statements to generate some really awesome text art.
# Let's help Sam create some great text art. All set to give it a try!

'''Task 1: Pattern Printing'''
print("**** Task 1: ****")
print()
# Uncomment the statements below and click Run to see what is displayed
#print("**pattern1**")
#i=1
#while(i<=5):
# print("*"*i)
# i=i+1
# Wow!! Wasn't that awesome!! Now if you want to reverse the pattern, how will you change the code to generate it?
print()
print()





'''Task 2: Combination Pattern'''
print("**** Task 2: ****")
print()
# Ready for the next challenge!
# You just created two patterns. Try combining them and see what you get




'''Task 3: Dazzling Diamond'''
print("**** Task 3: ****")
print()
# Challenge!! Lets write code to print pattern given below:
#*****  *****
