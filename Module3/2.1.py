''' Task 1: Number Buzzer Game'''
print("**** Task 1: ****")
print()
# Write a “Guess the Number”  game, where a player has to guess a number between 10 and 20.  Let's assume that the number to guess is 15.
# Let's add some checks to the game, you have written:
# If the number is lesser than 10, you must give a warning message and ask them to guess again
# If the number is greater than 20, you must give a warning message for the same and ask them to guess again
# If the number is right, then you display a congratulatory message



''' Task 2: Break the loop'''
print("**** Task 2: ****")
print()
# Now let's bring in a twist in the program you wrote in Task 1. # You need to modify the program, in a way that it allows only 3 chances to guess the number.



''' Task 3: To quit or not to quit'''
print("**** Task 3: ****")
print()
# Write a program that takes numbers between 1 and 100 from the user.
# To quit entering numbers the user needs to press 0. 
# The program should then display the sum and the product of the numbers.
