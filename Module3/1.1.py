# Sam, your friend wants to print his dog's name,Snoopy, five times.
# He asks you to help him, as you are learning to code in Python
# Can you help him?
'''Task 1: Repetition'''
print("**** Task 1: ****")
print()
# One of the ways is to use 5 print statements like this:
print ("Snoopy")
print ("Snoopy") 
print ("Snoopy")
print ("Snoopy")
print ("Snoopy")
#Better way is to use while loop
# The structure of the while loop is:
''' while <condition>:
      code to be repeated
      code to be repeated
    Code outside the loop '''
# Uncomment the next 4 lines to see the while loop in:
#counter = 1      	         # initialize a counter variable
#while counter <= 5:       # loop condition
 #print("Snoopy")  	   # code to execute
 #counter = counter + 1


'''Task 2: Print While You Can'''
print("**** Task 2: ****")
print()
# Sam is having fun learning with you. He wants  you to write a program to print the first 100 numbers.
# Can you do that? 
print("**Printing the first hundred numbers**")


#Also find total of first hundred numbers
print("**Printing the sum of first hundred numbers**")



'''Task 3: Print Within Limits'''
print("**** Task 3: ****")
print()
# The previous task has made Sam interested to write a program where he can find the sum of numbers from 1 to a number that the user wants. Can you help him?
# Hint: You can take that limit as input from the user, every time the program runs




'''Task 4: Reverse Printi'''
print("**** Task 4: ****")
print()
# Sam is really loving the way he is able to play with numbers using the while loop.
# He now wants to understand if he can do a reverse printing of numbers i.e.backward counting
# He wants you to write a program that will print the first 50 numbers backwards.
# Hint: Instead of assigning 0 to the counter, set it to 50, and decrement the counter(i.e. subtract by 1)
