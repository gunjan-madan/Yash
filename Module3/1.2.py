# Sam is slowly realising that he can solve Maths problems with while loops.
# So he wants you to help him with them.
# Are you ready to help him?
''' Task 1: Multiplication Table Generator '''
print("**** Task 1: ****")
print()
# Sam wants you to write a program that can generate a multiplication table for any number that is specified
# Remember to get the number for which the multiplication table needs to be generated from the user




''' Task 2: Whats the Average '''
print("**** Task 2: ****")
print()
# Help Sam write a program to calculate the average of five numbers.
# You need to get the numbers as an input from the users. You need to place the input statement within a while loop so that it gets executed n number of times and waits for the user input after every iteration.
# The first few lines of the program have been done for you. Uncomment them, complete the program and execute it to see if you get the result.

#tot=0
#counter = 1  	    
#while counter <=5:




''' Task 3: Skip Counting '''
print("**** Task 3: ****")
print()
# Sam is having fun with trying out math concepts in Python.
# He now wants to create a program which accepts a starting number and an ending number, which he calls the number limit. 
# Once that is done, he wants the program to print every third number that is within the number limit.
# Are you ready to take this challenge up?
