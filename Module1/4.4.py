# Can you write a program to swap values of two variables
# So what is swapping? 
# Swapping means interchanging the values in those variables. 


print(" ")
print("*** Task 1:***")
# Now let us swap the values.
# Uncomment the statements below and run to see how it executes:
#NAME = input()  
#Surname = input()
#print("Hello " + NAME + " " + Surname)

# Now to swap let us make use of another variable called temp
#temp = NAME
#NAME = Surname
#Surname = temp
#print("Hello " + NAME + " " + Surname)


# Initial state: a = 5 and b=7
# Final state:  a=7 and b=5
