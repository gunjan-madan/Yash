# You are a part of the sports committee in your apartment complex.
# The committee head wants your help in developing a rectangular piece of land into a playground
# Are you ready to use your Python programming skills in solving the issue.

# The Committee Head wants to convert a rectangular piece of land which is 118.5 meters long and 67.5 meters wide into a sports field.
# You and your friends propose the idea of splitting the land into a football pitch and hockey pitch with the following measurements:
#  91.5m long and 55m wide [football pitch] 
#  27 m long and 20.5 m wide [hockey pitch]
# The Committee head loves the idea. He decides to:  
# - First fence the sports field first and then 
# - Put artificial grass/turf for the hockey pitch. 
# He asks you to give the measurement for both so that he can get the materials.
# You decide to write a Python program to calculate the measures.
# So why wait, get programming!!
# Hint: For fencing, you need to get the perimeter of the sports field which is rectangular ( formula: perimeter - 2(length + width))
# Hint: For the artificial turf/grass, you need to get the area of the rectangular hockey pitch (Area = length * width]
