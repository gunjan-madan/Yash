#DIY
#add two numbers so that result is 20
#Subtract two numbers so that result is 20
#Multiply two numbers so that result is 20
#Divide two numbers so that result is 20

'''*****Task 2:  More Arithmetic Operators*****'''
print(" ")
print("*** Task 2:***")
# Uncomment the below statements and click Run
#t=5//3
#v=7%4
#w=2**3
#print(t)
#print(v)
#print(w)
# What did you get? Do you know why? 
# The // operator divides the 5  by 3 and only gives the integer value, not the remainder
# The % (modulus) operator gives the remainder when 7 is divided by 4.
# The ** is used like the exponent operator. So it is read as 2 raised to the power 3

#DIY
#Use to operators to print Quotient and Remainder when we divide 126 by 3
#Print 4^5 using the operators



'''*****Task 3: Magical Piggy Bank******'''
print(" ")
print("*** Task 3:***")
# Imagine you get up one morning and discover that  your piggy bank has turned magical. 
# Overnight it has been adding 2 gold coins.
# Now put on your calculating hat and write a python program to get the below answers:
# How many coins will you have if this goes on for a year?  
# Later you realise if you don't check the piggy bank by the end of the week it will take away 1 coin. 
# How much will you be left with ? 
# Had it come true you would have to share half of the coins with me? Now how much will you be left with?
