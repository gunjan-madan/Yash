#Date, time, timezone

# Can we automatically calculate the  age of a person or find out if the current year is a leap year or not.
# Let's take a look.  

'''Task 1: All about dates'''
print("***** Task 1: *****")
print()
# Well!!Python has a module called datetime to work with dates and perform calculations.
# Uncomment the statements below and click Run

#import datetime
#x = datetime.datetime.now()
#print("The current date is: ", datetime.datetime.now())
#print("The date today is: ",x.day)
#print("The current month is: ", x.month)
#print("The current year is: ", x.year)

# What do you think the program does? 
# Here is a list of some of the datetime functions that have been used in the above program:
# datetime.now()- Displays the current date 
# day - Displays the current date from the date returned by the datetime.now() function
# month - Displays the current month from the date returned by the datetime.now()
# year - Displays the current year from the date returned by the datetime.now()

'''Timezone '''
#By default Datetime will display UTC (Universal Time)
#To get time of a specific timezone, we need another module

# import datetime
# import pytz
# time_zone= pytz.timezone('US/Eastern')
# y= datetime.datetime.now(time_zone)
# print(y)

#List of all timezones
# for tz in pytz.all_timezones:
#   print(tz)


'''Task - Calculate age of the person'''
# Write a program that calculates the age of a person using the list of functions given in the table. 


'''Task 2: Is it a leap year or not'''
print("***** Task 2: *****")
print()
# Write a program to find if the current year is a leap year or not
# Hint: Any year that is divisible by 4  or 400 is a leap year



'''Task 3: Number of Days'''
print("***** Task 3: *****")
print()
# Write a program to display the number of days in the current month
# Hint: Use the datetime.datetime.now() function to get the month 


'''Fantastic!! You are good at writing programs using the datetime module. Way to go!!'''
