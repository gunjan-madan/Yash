# Can you find or match a string or a pattern in a given string?
# Python provides a built-in package called re, which can be used with Regular Expressions. 
# A regular expression is a sequence of characters used to "find" or "find and replace" strings. It is also used for validating or checking if the user input is correct.
# Let's take a look.


'''Task 1: Pattern search'''
print("***** Task 1:******")
print()
# Uncomment the below statements and click Run. Observe the output.
import re
txt = "HelloWorld"
x = re.search("World", txt)
print(x)
if x:
  print("Match found")
else:
  print("Match not found")

#Let us analyze the output . 
# We have imported a module called re that can be used to work with strings- using the import command. 
# Then the program searches for the string ->"World" and returns its position

# Here is a list of search patterns you can use 
#  re.search("[a-z]",string) - Searches for any lowercase characters in the string
#  re.search("[A-Z],string) - Searches for any uppercase characters in the string
#  re.search("[$#@]",string) - Searches for special characters in the string
#  re.search("\s",string) - Searches for white-space character in the string

# Using the information given in above, complete the Python program to check the strength of a password .
# You need to check for the following:
#   -Has at least one number.
#   -Has at least one uppercase and one lowercase character.
#   -Has at least one special symbol.
#   -Should be between 6 to 20 characters long.
# Uncomment the statement and complete the program
#import re                                                 
#p= input("Input your password: ")
#x = True
#while x:                          # while loop
#  if (len(p)<6 or len(p)>20):     # Password length
#      break                       # break statement
#  elif :                          # Lowercase validation
      
#  elif not                     # check for number              
      
#  elif not:                    # check for uppercase
#      break
#  elif not :                   #check for special character
#      break
#  elif:                      #check for whitespace character
#      break
#  else:
#      print("Valid Password")
#      x=False
#      break
#if x:
#  print("Not a Valid Password")

'''Task 2: How many vowels are in your name?'''
print("***** Task 2:******")
print()
# Write a program that takes the user’s name as the input
# If there are no vowels in the name, display a message -  “You have a unique with no vowels!!”
# If vowels are present in the name, display a message -”You have a lovely name!”


'''Task 3: This or That'''
print("***** Task 2:******")
print()
# Write a program that asks the user to input any text. The text could be a couple of words or a line or a quote.
# Your program must find if the text entered by the user has the word “this” or “that”.
