# Mr.Funky has just gotten started with writing functions.  
# He has been wondering if a function can have a default value set.
# Ready to check it out.

''' Task 1:  Defaultors '''
print("***** Task 1: *****")
print()
# Uncomment the statements below and click Run.

#def func(x=1):
#  y0 = x+ 1
#  y1 = x * 3
#  y2 = y0 ** 3
#  print("Value of y0 is: ", y0)
#  print("Value of y1 is: ", y1)
#  print("Value of y2 is: ", y2)
#print("Values without arguments")
#func()
#print()
#print("Values with arguments")
#func(3)

# What did you observe? 
# You can specify a default value for an argument.
# Default value is the value a function takes as an argument, if no argument value is passed.  
# Why do you think it is a good practice to specify default value for an argument? 
# You can avert errors if default value is specified. 

''' Task 2: Max or Min '''
print("***** Task 2: *****")
print()
# Write a function that takes two numbers as the input 
# - Returns the higher of the two.
# - If both the numbers are equal, it returns 0
# Set a default value for the argument
# Hint : Use if-else in the function

''' Task 3: Factorials '''
print("***** Task 3: *****")
print()
# Write a function to find the factorial of a number.
# The factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number. 
# For example, the factorial of 5 is 1*2*3*4*5 = 120 

''' Task 4: LCM '''
print("***** Task 3: *****")
print()
# Create a function to find the LCM of two numbers.
