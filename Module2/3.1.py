# In the previous lesson, you used if-elif-else statements to create a menu based program.
# Now let us take a look at using nested if-elif statements in creating menu based programs.
'''Task 1: Nested If-else'''
print()
print("*** Task 1: ***")
print()
#Make a variable like winning_number and assign any number to it between 1 and 20.
#Ask user to guess a number between 1 and 20. (Take input)
#if user guessed correctly, print "YOU WIN"
#if user didn't guessed correctly then:
  #if user guessed lower than actual number, then print "TOO LOW"
   #if user guessed lower than actual number, then print "TOO HIGH"

'''Task 2: Nested If-else'''

#This is a program to tell User the shipping cost based on the country and the weight.
#Write a Program that takes two inputs: country_code(AU/US) and weight of the product.
#Use the following conditions to find the shipping cost
#country          Product Size               Shippping cost
#US               less than 1kg               $5
#US               between 1 and 2kg           $10
#US               greater than 2kg            $20
#AU               less than 1kg               $10
#AU               between 1 and 2kg           $15
#AU               greater than 2kg            $25
